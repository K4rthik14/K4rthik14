### 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate learner and builder focused on Artificial Intelligence, Python, and building tools that make a difference. I believe in learning by doing — turning ideas into working code and solving real problems.

I aim to break into the world of cutting-edge AI, contribute to open source, and eventually build a SaaS business that empowers others — all while working toward my goal of studying at MIT.
